# Statistical-analysis-and-Machine-Learning

This repository contains codes from master's projects as well as the codes developed by me while I was working as Junior Research Fellow. There are 3 sub-folders as follows:

•	Classification_of_cancer_data_using_ML (classification of tissue samples into cancerous and non-cancerous tissue samples using machine learning based on Multi-omics data)

•	ML_on_speech_data (Classification of people into people having cold and people not having cold based on their speech data using SVM and deep learning)

•	risk_prediction (Development of risk prediction model for cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease death)
