The main focus of this study is to identify a supervised machine learning algorithm which can effectively classify different parts of a research paper abstract using a particular natural language  processing (NLP) technique and also try to shed light on imbalance in such datasets. Here, we classify sentences in PubMed Randomized control trials (RCT) abstracts into 5 categories viz; background, objective, methods, results and conclusions. The data is downloaded from KCL-Health-NLP github repository. TFIDF vectorizer and BERT large language model along with 5 machine learning algorithms are used to carry out this task.
